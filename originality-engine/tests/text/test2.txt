Java is a major island located in Southeast Asia and belongs to Indonesia, forming part of the Greater Sunda Islands group. The island lies between the Indian Ocean on its southern side and the Java Sea to the north, which connects to the Pacific Ocean. As of mid-2024, Java and its nearby island Madura together had an estimated population of around 156.9 million, with projections suggesting it may reach about 158 million by mid-2025. This makes Java the most densely populated island on Earth, accommodating nearly 56% of Indonesia’s total population despite covering only about 7% of the country’s land area. Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, is situated along Java’s northwest coastline.

Historically, Java has played a dominant role in shaping Indonesia. It served as the heart of influential Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms, later Islamic sultanates, and eventually became the administrative center of the Dutch East Indies during colonial rule. The island was also central to Indonesia’s independence movement throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Even today, Java holds significant political, economic, and cultural influence. Out of Indonesia’s eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, four are found on Java, including Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur, Prambanan, and the Sangiran Early Man Site.

Geologically, Java was created through intense volcanic activity caused by the subduction of the Australian tectonic plate beneath the Sunda Plate. Covering approximately 132,598 square kilometers in total area (including Madura), Java ranks as the 13th largest island globally and the fifth largest within Indonesia. The island is characterized by a continuous chain of volcanic mountains running from east to west, forming its central backbone.
