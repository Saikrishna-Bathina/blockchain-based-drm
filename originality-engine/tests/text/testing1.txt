Rama was the eldest prince of Ayodhya and the son of King Dasharatha.
He was known for his righteousness, obedience, and strong sense of duty.
Rama married Sita, who was later abducted by the demon king Ravana.
To rescue her, Rama traveled to Lanka with the help of Hanuman and an army of vanaras.
In a fierce battle, Rama defeated and killed Ravana, restoring peace and justice.
After completing his exile, Rama returned to Ayodhya and was crowned king.
